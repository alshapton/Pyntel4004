# Pyntel4004
A Python software implementation of the Intel 4004 processor.


## Design ethos
- As much of the internals as possible should be carried out using binary arithmetic and operations
- No external libraries to be used (i.e. pure Python)
- Build a fully-working i4004 assembly language interpreter
- Build a fully-working assembler which generates correct op-codes
- Construct a fully-working i4004 chip which can use the generated object code from the compiler (possibly using micro-python or circuit python on an Ardiuno Board)
