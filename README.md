A Python software implementation of the Intel 4004 processor.

## General Information

-  Two pass assembler using the original mnemonics, directives and comments syntax
-  Monitor facility to step through code and examine registers, memory etc

## Requirements

* `Python`_ >= 3.8.2
<br>

## Installation Instructions
<br>

### Source Code
Pyntel4004’s git repo is available on GitHub, which can be browsed [here](https://github.com/alshapton/pyntel4004) and cloned using:

```bash
 
    $ git clone https://github.com/alshapton/pyntel4004 pyntel4004
```

Verify the installation by running unit tests:
```bash

    $ cd pyntel4004/test
    $ pytest
```

## Usage Instructions

The user instructions can be found [here](https://pyntel4004.readthedocs.io/en/latest/intro/usage.html
)

## Design goals

- As much of the internals as possible should be carried out using binary arithmetic and operations.
- No 3rd party libraries to be used (i.e. pure Python).
- Build a fully-working i4004 opcode emulator.
- Build a fully-working assembler which generates correct op-codes.
- Construct a fully-working software-based i4004 chip which can use the generated object code from the compiler (possibly using micro-python or circuit python on an Ardiuno Board).

## Status

<br>
10-SEP-2021:    Documentation building and hosted with [READTHEDOCS](https://pyntel4004.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
<br>
12-JUN-2021:    Auto-build with GITHUB Actions implemented
<br>
18-MAY-2021:    Implementing full test suite
<br>
21-APR-2021:    Instruction Set functionally complete
                Entering Testing Phase

## Example

### Assembler Directives and other additions

Assembler directives are not part of the program itself, but can control things like starting address, and various environmental settings.

| Directive | Example | Meaning |
| :-:| :-:| :-|
| end | end | Indicating end of program, but not necessarily end of code |
| org | org 100 | Assemble and place object code commencing at address 100 |
| pin | pin 1 | Value of i4004's Pin 10 (test pin) |
|  / | / Author: ALS | A comment |
| label,| loop,| A label can be referred to in various control transfer statements. It MUST end in a comma (,)

## Monitor Commands

| Command | Example | Meaning |
| :-:| :-:| :-|
| "Enter" | "Enter"  | Execute the current instruction and move to the next |
|  acc    |   acc     | Show the current contents of the Accumulator |
|   b *n* |   b 71    | Create a breakpoint at address *n* |
|  carry  |  carry    | Show the current contents of the Carry Bit |
|  crb    |  crb     | Show the currently selected RAM Bank |
|  off    |  off     | Continue to execute the program with no trace |
|   pc    |   pc     | Show the Program Counter |
| pin10   | pin10    | Show the status of PIN10 on the i4004 chip (test pin)
|    q    |    q     | Quit the monitor without executing any further commands |
|  ram   |   ram     | Show the complete contents of RAM |
|  reg *n*  |  reg 7 | Show content of a specified register |
|  regs   |  regs    | Show all 16 registers |
|  rom    |   rom     | Show the complete contents of ROM |
| stack   |  stack   | Show the stack and the location of the stack pointer |
