Immediate Addressing
====================

.. include:: ../../global.rst


An immediate instruction is one that provides its own data. 
The following is an example of immediate addressing

.. code-block::

    Load the accumulator with the hexadecimal number 3
    
|just|

This instruction would appear in memory as follows:

.. image:: /intro/manual/images/immediate-diag.png
          :scale: 50%
          :align: center

The digit D signifies a "load accumulator immediate" instruction; the digit 3 is the number to be loaded.
