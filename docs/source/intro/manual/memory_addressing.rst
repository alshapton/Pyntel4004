Addressing specific memory bytes constitutes an important part of any computer program. 
There are a number of ways in which this can be done, as described below

    -   :ref:`Direct Addressing <direct>`
    -   :ref:`Same Page Addressing <same_page>`
    -   :ref:`Indirect Addressing <indirect>`
    -   :ref:`Immediate Addressing <immediate>`
    -   :ref:`Program RAM Addressing <program_ram>`
    -   :ref:`Data RAM Addressing <data_ram>`
    -   :ref:`Subroutines and the use of the stack for Addressing <subroutines_addressing>`
