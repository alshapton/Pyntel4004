Equate

.. include:: ../../global.rst

The "equate" pseudo instruction is indicated by the character **=** (equals sign) written in the code field of an assembler statement. 
No executable object code is generated by the pseudo instruction. 
It acts merely to provide the assembler with information to be used subsequently while generating object code.
