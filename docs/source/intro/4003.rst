The Intel 4003 Chip
===================

The Intel 4003 chip was introduced in 1971 as part of the Intel 4000 family; 10-bit Serial-in/Parallel-out, Serial-out Shift Register, fabricated with P-channel silicon gate MOS technology.


The 4003 was designed to be used with other MCS-4/40 devices such as the 4004 CPU.
Although produced by Intel, National Semiconductors was the only second source.

Logically, the Intel 4003 is set out as shown:

The circled numbers relate to the pins as shown below:

The 4003 performs two functions. As a RAM, it stores 320 bits arranged in 4 registers
of 20 x 4-bit characters each (16 main memory characters and 4 status characters).

In the RAM mode, the operation is as follows:
When the CPU executes an :ref:`SRC<hardware-machine-src>` instruction, it will send out the contents of 
the designated index register pair during X :subscript:`2` and X :subscript:`2` as an address to RAM,
and will activate 1 CM-RAM line at X :subscript:`2` for the `previously selected RAM bank`_
(see basic instruction cycle on page 5).

The data at X :subscript:`2` and X :subscript:`3` is interpreted as shown below:

As a vehicle for communication with peripheral devices, it is provided with 4 
output lines and associated control logic to perform output operations.


The status character locations (0 through 3) are selected by the OPA portion
of one of the I/O and RAM instructions.

For chip selection, the 4002 is available in two metal options, 4002-1 and 4002-2.
An extra pin, P :subscript:`0`, (which may be hard wired to either V :subscript:`DD` or V :subscript:`SS`) is also available for chip selection.

The chip number is assigned as follows:

     - D :subscript:`3` @  X :subscript:`2`

     - 4002-2

     - 1
     - 1


Timing is internally generated using two clock signals X :subscript:`1` and X :subscript:`2`, and a SYNC signal provided by the 4004.
Internal refresh circuitry maintains data levels in the cells.

All communications with the system is through the data bus. The I/O port permits data out of the system.
When the external RESET signal goes low, the memory and all static flip-flops (including the output registers)
will be cleared. To fully clear the memory, the RESET signal must be maintained for at least 32 memory cycles 
(32 x 8 clock periods).


.. _`previously selected RAM bank`:

.. note:: 
   **Previously Selected Ram Bank** |br|
   Bank switching is accomplished by the CPU after receiving a “:ref:`DCL<hardware-machine-dcl>`” (designate command line) instruction.
   Prior to the execution of the DCL instruction the desired CM-RAM :subscript:`i` code has been stored in the accumulator (for example, 
   through an LDM instruction). During DCL the CM-RAM :subscript:`1` code is transferred from the accumulator to the CM-RAM register.
   The RAM bank is then selected starting with the next instruction.
